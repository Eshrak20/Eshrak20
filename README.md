<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Eshràk G</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Full-Stack Developer & Computer Systems Enthusiast from Bangladesh</h3>

### 👨‍🎓 Overview
I’m a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer specializing in the **MERN stack**, building scalable web applications with **Express.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB**, and creating responsive UIs using **React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS**.  

Beyond software, I’m deeply fascinated by **how computers work at a low level**. I explore **hardware architecture, embedded systems, and robotics**, working with **motion sensors, light/fire/water sensors, obstacle detection, and microcontrollers**. I also have hands-on knowledge of **Linux internals, kernel concepts, memory management (RAM/ROM, buffers), CPU cores and threads, I/O operations, peripheral communication, IP addressing, MAC addresses, routing, server configuration, and basic network protocols**.  

Currently, I’m enhancing my skills with **Next.js, Prisma, GraphQL, and DevOps**, merging my love for backend systems with practical applications, while continuously exploring the intersection of **software and computer hardware**.
